## 1. Straightforward Prompts
Straightforward prompts request direct, concise answers without additional reasoning.  
They are used when quick, actionable responses are needed.

### Scenario 1
**Prompt:** “Why is my Wi-Fi not connecting?”  
**Response:** Check if the router is powered on, verify Wi-Fi is enabled on your device, and try reconnecting.

### Scenario 2
**Prompt:** “How do I restart my laptop?”  
**Response:** Click the Start menu, select the Power icon, and choose Restart.

## 2. Tabular Format Prompting
This technique organizes information into rows and columns for easy comparison.  
It is ideal when presenting multiple options, differences, or classifications.

### Scenario 1
**Prompt:** “Create a table showing common device issues and their quick fixes.”  
**Response:**

| Issue               | Quick Fix                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Battery draining   | Lower brightness               |
| App freezing       | Clear cache                    |
| Slow performance   | Close background apps          |
| No sound           | Check volume & audio settings  |

### Scenario 2
**Prompt:** “Give a table comparing three types of connectivity problems.”  
**Response:**

| Connectivity Issue    | Possible Cause               |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Bluetooth not pairing  | Out of range                 |
| Wi-Fi dropping         | Weak signal                  |
| Mobile data not working| Incorrect APN settings       |

## 3. Preceding Question Prompting
This technique maintains conversational context, where a follow-up question builds on the previous answer.  
It helps handle multi-step troubleshooting and clarification-based interactions.

### Scenario 1
**Main Prompt:** “Why is my phone overheating?”  
**Response:** It may overheat due to heavy apps, continuous gaming, or poor ventilation.

**Follow-Up Prompt:** “How can I reduce the overheating?”  
**Response:** Close background apps, avoid using the phone while charging, and keep it on a hard surface.

### Scenario 2
**Main Prompt:** “Why is my Bluetooth speaker disconnecting?”  
**Response:** The issue could be low battery, distance from device, or interference.

**Follow-Up Prompt:** “What should I do to fix it?”  
**Response:** Charge the speaker, move it closer, and turn off interfering devices.

## 4. Missing Word Prompting
This prompting type checks for specific factual recall by requiring the model to fill in the missing information.  
It is useful for short instructions, thresholds, and rule-based troubleshooting.

### Scenario 1
**Prompt:** “Restart the router if the internet is down for more than ____ minutes.”  
**Response:** **10**

### Scenario 2
**Prompt:** “Your device needs at least ____% battery to install the software update.”  
**Response:** **50**
